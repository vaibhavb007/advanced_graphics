Textures
--------
All textures are periodic.  They will repeat with no seams.  However,
they may have problems with "bands" appearing if they are rendered with
too many small copies.

brick.tex: (128x128) This is some reddish "staggered" bricks with grey
    mortar.  The bricks cast shadows.  One texture copy contains
    a full top brick and two "halves" of lower bricks.

boundingR.tex: (1kx1k).  This is the famous bounding R prman logo. Since it
    is a trademark of Pixar, it should not be used for any commercial
    purposes.

grass.tex: (128x128) A bright green lawn which will look like a golf green.
    This has "banding" problems.

lattice.tex: (64x64) A greyish-blue diagonal wooden lattice, like a rose
    trellis.  Casts shadows on itself.

pebbles.tex: (256x256) Lots of variously-sized and colored pebbles and
    rocks. Look as though they may be set in concrete, but not
    obviously.  This can have banding problems also.

shingle.tex: (128x128) Dark brown asphalt roof shingles. Non-overlapping.
    One texture copy contains one top shingle and two halves of
    lower shingles.

grid.tex: (512x512) Useful for showing the s,t grid of the surface
        for debugging purposes.

earth.tex: (256x128) Single channel greyscale of earth suitable for mapping 
    onto a sphere.

mona_smile.tex: (128x128) Single channel greyscale of Mona Lisa with
    silly grin.
